            <p>
                My name is David welcome to my flamenco site! I've been in love with flamenco since I was 15 and dedicated an immense amount of time to flamenco and the flamenco guitar especially. Living for a couple years in Jerez De La Frontera and for about 6 months filmed daily one on one lessons with many of the local flamenco guitarists, two in particular Pepe De Morao and Manuel Jero. I have many hours of these lessons and hope to share what I've learned, but with my own personal style. This site will release regular content about flamenco and advice to help people just getting into it. 
            </p>

                If you need a flamenco event, whether it be a small birthday celebration or a festival we'd love to organise something to your requirements. I also teach private flamenco guitar lessons for $60.
