  <h2>Flamenco Show</h2>
  <p>
    If you need a flamenco show, we'd love to organise something to your requirements. From a small birthday celebration to a festival. It can include flamenco dance, singing, guitar and percussion. 
  </p>

<h2>How To Play Flamenco Guitar</h2>

<h3>In Person</h3>
<p>Flamenco guitarists learned from direct contact with a  teacher. This is a great way to see every aspect up close of how theyâ€™re playing e.g. how to strum the flamenco guitar.  </p>

<h3>Flamenco Books</h3>
<p>
  Books are great because you can learn from many more teachers than you could in person. Getting the distinct opinions and perspectives of each. Each teacher will have pearls of wisdom.
</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>
  Videos allow you to pause or slow down the playing. You can copy a falsetta you wouldn't otherwise be able to learn. 
</p> 
<h3>Jamming</h3>
<p>
  Jamming with other guitarist teaches you to be more musical. It is the skill you need to develop if you want a career in music.
</p>
<p>
  You should learn from as many sources as possible. Even from someone not as good. They could teach you how dedicated they are or how they approach a certain aspect of playing the guitar.
</p>

<p>You never stop learning, but it can be difficult at the beginning. Its good to have a flamenco guitar teacher with experience. One who knows the guitar tricks to improve your playing. They know which roads are dead ends and can save you a lot of time.</p>




<p>The Spanish guitar is beautiful, it doesn't have to be hard to learn the flamenco guitar.</p>
